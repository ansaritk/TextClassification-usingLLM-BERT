# IMDB Text Classification Program
This project is a machine learning solution built to classify IMDB movie reviews by sentiment, categorizing reviews as positive or negative. Using the Hugging Face transformers library and pre-trained NLP models, this program demonstrates how to perform binary text classification through transfer learning.

## Key Features
Sentiment Analysis: Classifies movie reviews as positive or negative based on their text content.
Fine-Tuned Transformer Models: Leverages pre-trained transformer model - BERT, from the Hugging Face transformers library for improved accuracy.
Efficient Data Handling: Uses the Hugging Face datasets library to efficiently load, shuffle, and split the IMDB dataset for training and evaluation.
Metrics Tracking: Computes accuracy to evaluate model performance, with options for custom metric integration.
